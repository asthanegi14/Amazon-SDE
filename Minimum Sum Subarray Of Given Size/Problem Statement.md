**Problem Statement**
<br>
You hav been given an array 'ARR' of integers consisting of 'N' integers and a positive ibteger 'K'. Your task is to find a subarray(contiguous) of size 'K' such that the sum of its elements is minimum.
<br>

**Note:**
<br>
`You can assume that the value of 'K' will always be less than or equal to 'N'. So, the answer will always exist.`
<br>

**Input Format:**
<br>
`The First line of inpit contains two single space-separated integers 'N' and 'K' representing the size of the array and the given integer, respactively.`

<br>

`The secound line of input conatins 'N' single space-separated integers representing the array elments.`

<br>

**Output Format:**
<br>

`Print the minimum possible subarray sum.`

<br>

`Print the output of each test case in a new line.`

<br>

**Note**
<br>
`You don not need to print anything, it has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function.`

<br>

**Sample Input1:**
<br>
`8 3`
<br>

`10 4 2 5 6 3 8 1`

<br>

<br>

**Sample Output1:**
